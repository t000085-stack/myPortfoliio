          I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on creating clean,
          efficient, and user-friendly applications. I love solving complex
          problems and turning ideas into reality through code.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning new technologies, contributing
          to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with the developer
          community.
